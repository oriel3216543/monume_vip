# Enhanced Active Users Management Features

## Overview
This document outlines the enhanced features implemented for the MonuMe Tracker dashboard's active users management system, focusing on security, location-based access control, and improved user experience.

## üîß Implemented Features

### 1. **Password Verification for Inactive User Actions** ‚úÖ
- **What it does**: When making a user inactive, the system now requires password verification from the current user
- **How it works**: 
  - Click "Make Inactive" button ‚Üí Opens password confirmation modal
  - User must enter their own password to confirm the action
  - Prevents unauthorized deactivation of users
- **Security benefit**: Ensures only authenticated users can make others inactive

### 2. **Duplicate Session Prevention** ‚úÖ
- **What it does**: Prevents the same user from being active multiple times simultaneously
- **How it works**:
  - System checks if user is already active before allowing session start
  - Visual indicators show "Already Active" users with disabled cards
  - Multiple validation points during session creation process
- **User Experience**: Clear visual feedback and helpful error messages

### 3. **Enhanced Force-Out Modal with Manager/Admin Loading** ‚úÖ
- **What it does**: Improved force-out functionality with proper admin/manager authentication
- **Key improvements**:
  - Loads all available managers and admins from all locations (for admins) or current location (for non-admins)
  - Enhanced dropdown population with fallback to system admin
  - Better credential verification across multiple data sources
  - Location-aware admin selection
- **Security**: Multi-source credential verification with proper role checking

### 4. **Location-Based User Filtering** ‚úÖ
- **What it does**: Users only see and can manage users from their own location, admins see all
- **How it works**:
  - **Admin users**: Can see and manage users from ALL locations
  - **Location-specific users**: Only see users assigned to their location
  - **Filtering applied to**:
    - User selection modal (Start Session)
    - Active users management modal
    - Force-out admin selection
- **Data structure**: Supports both legacy `users` array and new `locationUsers` object

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### Location-Based Data Structure
```javascript
const locationUsersMap = {
    'Location1': [
        { username: 'manager', name: 'Location Manager', role: 'manager', location: 'Location1' },
        { username: 'staff1', name: 'Sarah Johnson', role: 'staff', location: 'Location1' }
    ],
    'Location2': [
        { username: 'manager2', name: 'Emma Davis', role: 'manager', location: 'Location2' },
        { username: 'staff3', name: 'David Kim', role: 'staff', location: 'Location2' }
    ]
};
```

### Key Functions Added

#### `getFilteredUsers()`
- Filters users based on current user's role and location
- Admins see all users, others see only their location users
- Handles both legacy and new data structures

#### `isUserAlreadyActive(username)`
- Checks if a user is currently active (within 5 minutes)
- Prevents duplicate sessions
- Used in multiple validation points

#### `openInactiveModal(username)`
- Opens password verification modal for making users inactive
- Requires current user's password confirmation
- Enhanced security for user management actions

#### `populateAdminSelect()` (Enhanced)
- Loads managers and admins based on current user's permissions
- Admins see all managers/admins from all locations
- Non-admins see only their location's managers/admins
- Includes fallback to system admin if none found

## üé® UI/UX Enhancements

### Visual Indicators
- **Already Active Users**: Grayed out cards with "Already Active" status
- **Location Display**: Shows user's location in user cards
- **Enhanced Modals**: Better styling and user feedback
- **Error Messages**: Clear, actionable error messages

### User Experience Improvements
- **Hover Effects**: Disabled for already active users
- **Loading States**: Clear feedback during operations
- **Validation Messages**: Helpful error messages and success notifications
- **Responsive Design**: Works well across different screen sizes

## üß™ Testing Functions

### Available Test Functions in Browser Console:

```javascript
// Test location filtering
testLocationFiltering();

// Test force-out functionality
testForceOutFunctionality();

// Test start session modal
testStartSessionModal();
```

## üîê Security Features

1. **Password Verification**: Required for user state changes
2. **Role-Based Access**: Different permissions for admin/manager/staff
3. **Location Isolation**: Users can only access their location's data
4. **Multi-Source Credential Verification**: Checks multiple data sources for authentication
5. **Session Validation**: Multiple checkpoints prevent duplicate sessions

## üìã User Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Admin User
- Sees all users from all locations
- Can force out any user with proper authentication
- Has access to all managers/admins for force-out authorization

### Scenario 2: Location Manager
- Sees only users from their assigned location
- Can force out users in their location
- Limited to managers/admins from their location for authorization

### Scenario 3: Staff Member
- Sees only users from their location
- Cannot access force-out functionality
- Can start sessions and make users inactive with password verification

## üöÄ Demo Data

The system initializes with sample location-based users:

- **Location1**: Manager, Employee, Sarah Johnson, Mike Chen
- **Location2**: Emma Davis (Manager), David Kim, Lisa Wong
- **System Admin**: Can access all locations

## üìù Usage Instructions

1. **Login** with appropriate credentials (admin, manager, or location-specific user)
2. **Start Session**: Click "Start Session" ‚Üí Select available user ‚Üí Enter password
3. **View Active Users**: Click "View Active" to see currently active users
4. **Make Inactive**: Click "Make Inactive" ‚Üí Enter your password to confirm
5. **Force Out** (Admin/Manager only): Click "Force Out" ‚Üí Select admin/manager ‚Üí Enter their password

## üîß Configuration

The system automatically detects and configures based on:
- Current user's role (`localStorage.getItem('role')`)
- Current user's location (`localStorage.getItem('location')`)
- Available user data in `localStorage`

## üìà Benefits

1. **Enhanced Security**: Password verification and role-based access
2. **Better Organization**: Location-based user management
3. **Improved UX**: Clear visual feedback and intuitive workflows
4. **Scalability**: Supports multiple locations and user hierarchies
5. **Compliance**: Audit trail for user management actions
